la certitud de laquel neut pa lieu de douter desqu la nouvel fut venu batavia anno 1659 que le vaisseau le dragon qui venoit de holland aux ind avoit fait naufrag sur le cote dune terr austral inconnu envoia la flute la bouee la veill pour ramen ceux de gen de lequipag qui auroient pu se sauver et le efet qui auroient ete conservez la flute etant conduit par ceux qui etoient echapez du naufrag dan la chaloup et venu batavia en aport la nouvel se rendit au parag ou le dragon avoit peri et alla mouiller lancr dan lendroit qui parut le plu propr pour son dessein aussi tot la chaloup fut arme pour aller chercher ceux qui setoient sauvez le long du rivag ell saprocha dabord du bri pardessu lequel le vagu passoient pui ell nagea ver le lieu ou lon avoit dress de tent quand la chaloup du vaisseau peri partit pour ceux quell navoit pu recevoir et qui devoient attendr la quon vint le prendr lequipag etant descendu terr trouva le tent brise en piec et lon ne decouvrit pa un seul homm dan tout le pai la surpris ne fut pa mediocr regarda partout si lon ne verroit point de trace qui marquass quon eut construit quelqu petit batiment mai il ny avoit ni tarrier ni hach ni couteaux ni cloux etc il ny avoit ni ecrit ni indic par ou lon put conjectur ce quetoient devenu le gen quon avoit la laissez la chaloup etant retourne bord et aiant annonc cett nouvel il fut resolu que lon iroit chercher plu avant dan le terr et le long du rivag pour cet efet se divisa en plusieur troup et lon ne reussit pa mieux que la premier foi eut beau crier apel tirer de coup de mousquet tout fut inutil et je nai pa seu quon ait jamai apri ce quetoient devenu ce gensla retourna donc au bri dont ne put rien tirer le lame aiant emport le bordag le ecoutil et fracass tout le vaisseau tant la mer brise fort en ce parag ainsi lon jugea que le plu expedi etoit de sen retourn puisquon navoit rien pretendr et quon avoit craindr le vent forcez et le tempet qui selon le apar auroient aussi fait perir la flute dan ce dessein alla fair de leau ceux qui furent une petit rivier quon avoit vue aulieu de se hater se promener et courur en diver endroit cepend il seleva une si terribl tempet que la flute fut contraint de se mettr au larg ou ell atendit encor quelqu tem mai comm la chaloup ne revenoit point jugea quell avoit peri sibien quon reprit la rout de batavia ou lon fit le raport de ce qui setoit pass quand lorag eut cess lequipag de la chaloup se rembarqua pour retourn bord mai il ne trouva plu la flute ni sur la cote ni au larg la tristess ne fut pa moindr que letonn et lon ne seut quel parti prendr enfin il fallut retourn terr pour netr pa englouti par le flot mai navoit point de vivr et lon ne voioit rien dan tout le pai qui put servir de nouritur le montagn netoient que de rocher le vale etoient de vrai desert le plain netoient que de sabl le rivag etoit aussi bord de roch contr lesquel la mer brisoit avec defroiabl mugissemen ceux qui etoient la demeurez se trouvoient au nombr de treiz homm qui furent bientot fatiguez afoibl et attenuez la faim le pressoit le froid et lhumidit le faisoient soufrir et il se regardoi comm condamnez la mort il ny avoit rien esper du bri le vagu avoient tout fait rouler ca et la dan la mer enfin forc de courir et de chercher quelqu chose quil pussent manger il apercur entr le rocher qui etoient le long du rivag de gro limacon et de plu petit qui venoient de la mer et dont le gout qui etoit passabl parut excel de gen affamez mai naiant point de feu pour le fair cuir lusag continuel quil en firent commenca de le incommod et il sentir bien que ce foibl remed ne le empecheroit pa de mourir dan peu de tem enfin ne voiant de tout part quun mort certain il prirent la resolut de sexpos la merci de flot dan lesper que sil ne se presentoit rien de plu favor pour eux sur la mer que sur la terr au moin la mort quil trouveroi seroit plu promt et le delivreroit plutot de leur miser cepend il se flatoient encor de lesper de pouvoir abord en quelqu autr pai ou il auroit de chose propr pour la nourritur de homm ainsi chacun travailla selon se forc calfat la chaloup fair provis de limacon remplir de futail deau apr cela lon mit le batiment la mer et lon quitta ce lieu ou lon navoit vu que de desert arid et de feux folet et ou il ny avoit ni bete ni gen perdit bientot de vue ce pai steril le second pilot de la flute etant parmi cett troup desole et la guidant par le cour du soleil de la lune et de etoil cepend il avoient troi quatr cent lieue de chemin fair pour terrir la cote septentrional de la grand java peut assez simagin quell soufranc il furent exposez dan un tel batiment pendent une tell rout et avec sipeu de vivr et simauvai par le beau tem il voguoient encor passabl mai quand la mer etoit gross le lame le couvroient et passoient pardessu leur tete et la chaloup etoit toujour sur le point de se voir submerge mai la plu cruell avantur fut que le limacon se corrompir et il ny eut plu moien den manger sibien que pour tout aliment il ne resta que de leau la nuit il faisoit un froid insuport et le jour etoit brule de ardeur du soleil tout esper de salut sembloit etr retranche et le fatigu aussibien
